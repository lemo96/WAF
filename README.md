# WAF
A simple and powerful script to block DDoS and botnet attacks [Linux / Directadmin / WHM /cPanel/Plesk/Apache/Nginx]

This script will help you to prevent attacks on your Linux server.
The most common use of this script is for websites that use ports 80 or 443, etc.

# How it worked:
If more than 20 simultaneous connections are made from one IP on port 443, it will block it for 3600 seconds.

Before running, change the following values according to your needs. [edit: loop_block_ddoser_ip.sh]

PORT = "443"

Blocklist_TIME = "3600"

Server_public_ip = "1.2.3.4"
